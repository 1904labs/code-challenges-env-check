# 1904labs Code Challenge Environment Check

This repo is meant to serve as a helpful check for candidates interviewing remotely with 1904labs.  You will find several projects structured in the same way we structure our technical challenge, only with a working "hello world" example instead of the technical challenge.  It's meant to reduce the anxiety of interviewees and reduce technical struggles the day of the interview.

In theory, if you can run these projects fine on your machine, you should be fine the day of the interview.  If not, you have ample time to find a working configuration.

## Steps to ensure your environment is ready for the technical challenge
1) Clone/Download this repository
1) Choose the language you are planning to complete the challenge and open in your preferred IDE
1) Follow the instructions in the individual README and make sure you can successfully accomplish all steps
  1) If you cannot run all commands indicated and see the expected output, please check the versions below and make sure your environment is setup correctly.
  1) If you believe there is an issue with any test project here, please reach out to your recruiter.
